# Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Treatment Plan

## Risk Assessment
Your 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events is: 2.7% ([HeartScore Calculator](https://heartscore.escardio.org/Calculate/quickcalculator.aspx?model=low))

## Diagnoses
- Dyslipedemia
- Prediabetes 
- Metabolic syndrome
- Elevated blood pressure
- Insulin resistance

## Treatment Plan
*Focusing on metabolic syndrome due to its significant association with increased cardiovascular disease risk*

### Non-pharmacological Interventions

#### Exercise Recommendations [3,4]

##### Aerobic Exercise
- **Frequency:** 5–7 days per week
- **Intensity:** Moderate to vigorous intensity
- **Time:** ≥30 minutes per day of continuous or accumulated exercise
- **Type:** Prolonged, rhythmic activities using large muscle groups (e.g., running, cycling, swimming)

##### Resistance Exercise
- **Frequency:** 2–3 days per week
- **Intensity:** 30%–70% 1-RM
- **Time:** 2–4 sets of 8–12 repetitions to volitional failure for each major muscle group
- **Type:** Resistance machines, free weights, and/or body weight

#### Weight Management
Target weight reduction: 5-10% of initial body weight ([Weight Planner](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp))
- Goal: Lose 5-10% initial body weight within 180 days
- Caloric reduction: 248 – 492 kcal/day
- Daily caloric intake goal: 1395 - 1639 kcals/day
- Assumed TDEE: 2223 kcal/day

#### Nutrition Guidelines [2]

##### Macronutrient Distribution
- **Protein:** 15 - 20%
- **Fat:** 25 - 40%
  - Avoid trans fat
  - Saturated fat < 10%
  - Include 2g vegetable oil/day
- **Carbohydrates:** 45 - 55% [5]
  - Dietary fiber: 20 – 40 g/day (from legumes, fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals)

#### Lifestyle Modifications
- Smoking cessation
- Moderate alcohol intake (< 10g/day EtOH)

#### Supplements
- Vitamin E [5]

### Pharmacological Interventions
- Statins
